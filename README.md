### Education
- Ph.D. Mathematics, Iowa State University, 2024
- Ms.C. Statistics, Iowa State University, 2022


### Work Experience

- **AI Engineer @ Radical AI**  
  *Jun 2024 - Present*  
  - **Engineered and deployed** an Intelligent Teaching Assistant system using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Google Cloud Vertex AI** to dynamically generate adaptive syllabus content and AI-resistant assignments, ensuring educational objectives are met through advanced natural language understanding and transformer-based architectures.
  - **Developed robust NLP pipelines** for document ingestion, semantic parsing, and text chunking; **optimized processing frameworks** to handle large datasets efficiently, enhancing scalability and performance for automated content creation.

- **Data Scientist @ Iowa State University**  
  *Jun 2023 - May 2024*  
  - **Automated web-scraping pipelines** using Selenium with advanced techniques like **WebDriverWait**, **expected_conditions (EC)**, and **ActionChains** to handle dynamic web elements, dropdown menus, and asynchronous content, ensuring reliable and error-resilient data extraction.
  - **Optimized ETL workflows** by streamlining Chrome WebDriver configurations, reducing data extraction time by 60%, and enabling efficient file handling for downstream analysis.

- **Data Analyst and Research Assistant @ Iowa State University, Ames, IA**  
  *Aug 2017 - May 2023*  
  - Conducted a **hierarchical logistic regression** on the **HSLS:09 study** to evaluate the role of **institutional agent-related social capital** in immigrant students' advanced math enrollment. Applied **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) imputation** to handle missing data and identified key predictors to inform **equitable access strategies**.
  - **Developed and deployed advanced statistical models** for the IM2EB project, leveraging techniques such as **generalized linear models (GLMs)** and **non-parametric analysis** to derive actionable insights, highlighting improvements in teaching practices ranging from **21% to 36%**.
  - **Led the end-to-end data science lifecycle**, including data preprocessing (e.g., normalization, outlier detection), feature engineering (e.g., interaction terms, categorical encoding), and predictive modeling using **multi-level regression** and **cross-validated model evaluation**, achieving an **86% explanation of variance** in student ISASP scores.
